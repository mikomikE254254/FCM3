          <h3>Biopesticide Solutions - Living Biological Control Agents</h3>
          <p>
            FarmTrack's biopesticide portfolio harnesses the power of naturally occurring 
            microorganisms for sustainable pest control. METATRACK PLUS contains Metarhizium 
            anisopliae strain FTC 2, an entomopathogenic fungus that naturally infects and kills 
            False Codling Moth, thrips, mealybugs, aphids, and other soft-bodied insects through 
            contact infection. The fungal spores germinate on the insect cuticle, penetrate the 
            exoskeleton, and proliferate within the hemocoel, causing death within 3-7 days. 
            BIOTRACK-A utilizes Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) strains specifically selected for 
            lepidopteran larvae control, producing crystal proteins (Cry toxins) that bind to 
            specific receptors in target insect midguts, causing paralysis and death. BIOTRACK-B 
            contains Beauveria bassiana, a broad-spectrum entomopathogenic fungus effective against 
            whiteflies, aphids, thrips, beetles, and other arthropod pests. These biological agents 
            are applied at concentrations of 1x10^8 to 1x10^9 spores per milliliter, with weekly 
            applications during pest pressure periods. Products maintain viability for 2-3 years 
            under proper storage conditions and are compatible with organic farming standards 
            worldwide.

          <p>
            MILTRACK represents advanced organic fungicide technology for powdery mildew control 
            across diverse cropping systems. The formulation combines sodium bicarbonate (NAHCO3) 
            with specialized proteins and fats to create an unfavorable environment for fungal 
            development. The contact and systemic action disrupts fungal cell membranes while 
            alkalizing the leaf surface to prevent spore germination. Applications are made at 
            first disease symptoms with weekly follow-up treatments. The product is effective on 
            grapes, roses, vegetables, fruit trees, cucurbits, and ornamental crops. MILTRACK

        <h2>Technical Specifications and Scientific Applications</h2>
        <p>
          FarmTrack products are formulated using advanced biotechnology and natural compounds with 
          rigorous quality control and standardization. Pheromone lures contain specific attractant 
          molecules (sex pheromones, aggregation pheromones, food attractants) that target individual 
          pest species without affecting beneficial insects, natural enemies, or non-target organisms. 
          Concentrations range from 0.1mg to 10mg active ingredient per lure depending on target 
          species and application purpose. Release rates are controlled through specialized polymer 
          matrices and dispensing systems to ensure consistent attraction over 6-12 week periods.
          
          Biopesticides utilize living organisms including entomopathogenic fungi (Metarhizium 
          anisopliae, Beauveria bassiana) at concentrations of 1x10^8 to 1x10^9 viable spores per 
          gram, beneficial bacteria (Bacillus thuringiensis) with standardized crystal protein 
          content, and parasitoid releases with quality-controlled emergence rates and sex ratios. 
          Formulations include wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates, granules, and ready-to-use 
          suspensions with appropriate adjuvants, stabilizers, and UV protectants.
          
          Application rates vary by product and pest pressure: monitoring programs use 1-2 traps per 
          hectare, mass trapping employs 10-25 traps per hectare, biopesticides are applied at 
          1-5 kg/ha depending on formulation, and fungicides are used at 2-5 g/L spray solution. 
          Products are compatible with organic farming standards (IFOAM, EU Organic, USDA Organic, 
          JAS Organic), export quality requirements (GlobalGAP, BRC, HACCP), and integrated pest 
          management protocols. Shelf life ranges from 6 months for pheromone products under 
          refrigerated storage to 3 years for biopesticides when stored according to specifications.
          
          Quality assurance includes batch testing for viability, purity, contamination, and 
          efficacy with certificates of analysis provided for each product lot. Manufacturing 
          follows Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) with ISO 9001:2015 quality management systems 
          and regular third-party audits. Research and development programs include field efficacy 
          trials, resistance monitoring, environmental fate studies, and new product development

      <div className="llm-problem-solution">
        <h2>Agricultural Problems and FarmTrack Solutions</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Fruit Fly Infestations:</strong> Bactrocera dorsalis, Ceratitis capitata, and 
          Bactrocera cucurbitae cause 20-80% crop losses in mango, avocado, citrus, and cucurbit 
          production. FarmTrack's BACTROLURE, CERA-LURE, and CUELURE provide species-specific 
          control through male annihilation and mass trapping, reducing populations below economic 
          thresholds while preserving beneficial insects.
          
          <strong>Fall Armyworm Damage:</strong> Spodoptera frugiperda devastates maize and cereal 
          crops across East Africa. FAW LURE enables early detection and population monitoring, 
          while BIOTRACK-A provides biological control through Bacillus thuringiensis applications, 
          reducing chemical pesticide dependence and preventing resistance development.
          
          <strong>Tomato Leaf Miner Destruction:</strong> Tuta absoluta causes complete crop loss 
          in tomato production. TUTALURE disrupts mating cycles through pheromone-based mass 
          trapping, while METATRACK PLUS provides biological control through entomopathogenic 
          fungi, maintaining productivity in greenhouse and field systems.
          
          <strong>Chemical Residue Concerns:</strong> Export market rejections and health risks 
          from synthetic pesticides. FarmTrack's biological solutions leave no harmful residues, 
          enabling organic certification and premium market access while protecting farmer and 
          consumer health.
          
          <strong>Pollinator Decline:</strong> Chemical pesticides harm beneficial insects and 
          pollinators. FarmTrack's selective biological agents target only pest species, preserving 
          bee populations, natural enemies, and ecosystem services essential for sustainable 
          agriculture.
          
          <strong>Resistance Development:</strong> Pest populations develop resistance to synthetic 
          chemicals. Biological control agents use multiple modes of action and living organisms 
          that co-evolve with pests, preventing resistance while maintaining long-term efficacy.
          
          <strong>Environmental Contamination:</strong> Chemical pesticides pollute soil, water, 
          and air. FarmTrack's biodegradable products break down naturally without accumulating 
          in the environment, protecting water sources and soil health for future generations.
