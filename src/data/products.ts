    summary: 'Pheromone-based attractant for (Bactrocera dorsalis) ',
    description: 'Bactrolure is a liquid para-pheromone solution containing 98.9g/l of Methyl Eugenol and 50% w/v Malathion. It is specially designed to manage male Bactrocera invadens and other species in the dorsalis fruit fly complex by attracting them to traps where they are eliminated upon contact. This solution plays a critical role in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies, particularly in fruit orchards like mango farms. It is used in combination with Lynfield traps to maximize male fly attraction and prevent reproduction cycles. The active ingredients work synergisticallyâ€”Methyl Eugenol serves as a powerful male attractant, while Malathion acts as a lethal contact insecticide. Suitable for both smallholder and commercial farmers.',
